		Description	     = "Unmanaged devices pose a risk, since their security cannot be verified through existing security policies, brokers or endpoint protection. Allowing users to sync data to these devices takes that data out of the control of the organization. This increases the risk of the data either being intentionally or accidentally leaked. Note: This setting is only applicable to Active Directory domains when operating in a hybrid configuration. It does not apply to Azure AD domains. If there are devices which are only Azure AD joined, consider using a Conditional Access Policy instead."
